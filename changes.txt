Changelog Projects:

Notes:
- Learn how to create a good flow chart of programs, how to efficiently divide tasks and set priorities.
- Try to think ahead about how I want the program to function.


Succesfully implemented and tested:
- NONE YET

To be implemented:
- Calculator (WIP)
- Student enroller
- Number guesser, both ways
- Random selector
- Age calculator
- Sports planner, inputs goals and time. Link with database.

V0.006:
- Implemented menu in calculator, figured it'd be better than asking the user to always create a custom formula.
- Moved previous main() into switch case 7, still incomplete though. See notes in beginning of Calculator.java.
- Moved entire menu in do while loop, only exits when boolean exit flag equals true.
- Added "press enter to continue.." prompt after every calculation. This way the user gets to read the output of the formula before the menu prints again.
- Need to refactor menu in Main Menu class, implementation in calculator looks better.

V0.005:
- Created multiple new datapoints: variable1, variable2 & result. These will be used in all functions.
- Refactored main, int variables is now called varAmount.
- Refactored main to accept double datatype as input instead of integer, this way user can input numbers like 3.33 instead of only allowing whole numbers. Only refactored for variables input, not for amount of variables as it isn't needed.
- Implemented and tested all manipulating functions.
- Rethinking how the program should work, see correctbook.

V0.004:
- Got an exception in the calculator if I try to input 1 or 0 for the amount of variables, java.util.NoSuchElementException specifically.
- Seems to be related to closing the scanner, commented out those lines and it worked again.
- Apparantly closing the scanner is not something what you want to do, unless you don't want to be able to input anything again. 
- Created several functions for manipulation of variables in Calculator.

V0.003:
- Worked out why exception handling didn't work in the calculator, turns out I had to initialize the variable before the loop.

V0.002:
- Succesfully implemented exception handling in the main menu.
- Started working on Calculator.
	- See correctbook for desired workings.
- Tried to implement exception handling for variable input, keeps looping after catching exception.

V0.001:
- Created menu.java to access and interact with different projects.
- Added user input.
- Attempted to create a try and catch exception.
